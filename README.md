Derrick:
Here we will discuss the Black Jack Game. In this game, we have decided to use the game layout based on the real world casino examples from online to offline.
So the basic idea is that it has the popular design where the cards are displayed in the center and control buttons are laid on the bottom.

Lincoln:
We have also look for the game assets online, which we have already referenced in the Documentation. The assets we used are the card images, background and the casino table itself. 

Derrick:
We have implemented Gestalt principle as well. For example: **Proximiti**, **Similarity** ,**Figure ground**.

Firstly, In Proximiti where player and dealer cards are grouped together and uniformly on the top and bottom. 
Secondly, in **Similarity** , All cards are the same shape, colour and style.
In addition **Figure ground** ,  is used to ensure everything is clear and visible 
we make sure that there is high color contrast between the elements and background.

Lincoln: 
and for the Neilsen's Usability Heuritics. **Visibility of system status** where the game clearly shows the player and dealer points. and it has an immediate response time as well.
Lastly, **Match between System and the real world**, which Derrick has already said in the beginning, where the real world logic and layout has been used.

Derrick:
Describe the UI and layout clearly

Lincoln:
Describe the gameplay. loss win push, player bust, dealer bust.
