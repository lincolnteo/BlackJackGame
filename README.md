Hi im derrick

Derrick:
In this game we have decided to use the real world blackjack game layout from online casino's we have research. so it has the common design where there is cards at the top and bottom with the control on the bottom.

Lincoln:
We have also look for the game assets online which we have already reference in the Documentation. The assets we used are the card images, the backgound and the casino table itself. 

Derrick:
We have implemented a few Gestalt principle as well. Firstly, **Proximiti**, player cards and dealer cards are grouped together uniformly on the top and bottom. **Similarity** ,All cards uses the same shape colour and style. Lastly, **Figure ground** ,  to ensure everything is clear and visible we made sure that there is high contrast between the elements and dark back ground colour

Lincoln: 
and for the Neilsen's Usability Heuritics. **Visibility of system status** where the game clearly shows the player and dealer points and has a immediate respond time. Lastly, **Match between System and the real world**, which derrick have already said in the beginning, where the real world logic and layout has been used.

Derrick:
Describe the UI and layout clearly

Lincoln:
Describe the gameplay. loss win push, player bust, dealer bust.
